    <h1 align="middle">Fluid Super Resolution</h1>
    <h3 align="middle">Charles Cai, Congrong Xu, Franklin Zhang, Yunqi Li</h3>

    <h2 align="middle">Abstract</h2>
    <p align="left">In this project, we focus on enhancing the efficiency of fluid simulations by applying super-resolution techniques to low-resolution fluid simulation data.
        We began by generating a comprehensive dataset of 2,000 fluid simulations at two resolutions: low (8x8) and high (64x64). 
        This dataset was then used to train a VQ-VAE-2 model, which super-resolves the low-resolution data. 
        We also comprehensively evaluated the performance of our super_resolution model using 3 metrics: Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and Physics Loss. 
        To demonstrate the efficiency of our approach, we developed a Super-Resolution Rendering Pipeline. 
        This setup allowed us to compare the rendering speeds of traditional fluid simulations with our super-resolution method, highlighting the efficiency gains achieved through our technique.
        For better visualization, we also developed a Real-time Rendering Pipeline to visualize our fluid simulation method in real-time.
    </p>

    <div>
        <h2 align="middle">Technical Approach</h2>
        <h3 align="left">Simulation Method</h3>
        <p align="left"> We apply the spectral method to simulate fluids, which is often employed in computational fluid
            dynamics (CFD).
            The spectral method is a numerical technique used to approximate solutions to differential equations
            by representing the solution as a sum of basis functions in the spectral domain after applying Fourier
            Transform.
            The spectral method is particularly useful for solving partial differential equations in multiple
            dimensions.
            In the context of fluid dynamics, spectral methods are often employed for solving the Navier-Stokes
            equations,
            which indicate the pattern of fluid flow.
        </p>

        <p align="left"> When it comes to fluid simulation using spectral methods, the Poisson equation and the
            Crank-Nicolson update
            are key components used in conjunction with the Navier-Stokes equations. In this case, we solved the Poisson
            equation in Fourier space
            to calculate the vorticity field from the velocity field. And use the Crank-Nicolson method to update the
            vorticity field,
            incorporating nonlinear advection, diffusion, and forcing effects, thus advancing the fluid simulation over
            successive time steps.
        </p>

        <h3 align="left">Fluid Simulations Dataset</h3>
        <p align="left"> We have generated a comprehensive dataset of 2,000 fluid simulations of 2D incompressible viscous fluid
            using the method described in the previous section.
            The simulations were performed on a 256x256 grid, subsampled to 64x64 for efficient storage. Each simulation
            captures the
            evolution of the vorticity field over a total time of 20.0 units, with a time step of 1e-4 and a viscosity
            of 1e-3.</p>

        <p align="left"> To create diverse initial conditions, we sampled the initial vorticity fields from a 2D
            Gaussian Random
            Field with
            covariance parameters alpha=2.5 and tau=7. The simulations were solved using a spectral method in Fourier
            space with a
            Crank-Nicolson time-stepping scheme, incorporating a forcing term defined as 0.1*(sin(2pi(x+y)) +
            cos(2pi(x+y))).</p>

        <p align="left">For each simulation, we recorded 200 snapshots(1 snapshots per 0.1s) of the vorticity field at
            equally spaced
            intervals, along with
            the
            vorticity fields at the previous and next time steps. The dataset was generated in batches of 40 simulations
            to manage computational resources
            efficiently.</p>
        <h3 align="left">VAE Training Pipeline For Super Resolution</h3>
        <p align="left"> We build up a VQ-VAE-2 training pipeline for the super resolution of fluid simulation data.
        </p>
        <!-- number list -->
        <ol>
            </li>
            <li> Upsample the low-resolution data by a factor of 8 using bilinear interpolation and obtain the model input data.</li>
            <li> Concatenate 3 frames of the upsampled data to form the input to the VQ-VAE-2 model(Each frame differs
                by 0.5s). </li>
            <li> Feed the input date into the VQ-VAE-2 model to reconstruct the 3 frames of high-resolution data. </li>
            <li> Only pick the middle frame of the reconstructed data as the output and compute the reconstruction loss with the high-resolution ground truth.
            </li>
        </ol>

            <!-- <figcaption align="center">VQ-VAE-2 Pipeline</figcaption> -->
        </figure>

        <h3 align="left">Super-Resolution Simulation Pipeline</h3>
        Suppose we're given a initial condition of the fluid vorticity field at 64*64 resolution, and we want its vorticity field for the next T s every 0.1s.
        For better accuracy, we want to simulate it using delta t = 1e-3s. 
        <ol>
            <li> Downsample the high-resolution data to 8*8 resolution using bilinear interpolation. </li>
            <li> Simulate the fluid at 8*8 resolution for T seconds using delta t = 1e-3s. </li>
            <li> Sample the vorticity field every 0.1s and use the VQ-VAE-2 model to super-resolve the low-resolution vorticity field to 64*64 resolution. </li>
        </ol>

        <h3 align="left">Real-time Rendering Pipeline</h3>
        We have developed a real-time rendering pipeline to visualize our fluid simulation method in realtime.
        The pipeline consists of a fluid simulation module and a rendering module. The fluid simulation module generates
        the vorticity field at each time step, while the rendering module use vae to super-resolve the low-resolution frame and visualize the vorticity field every 0.1s.

        <h2 align="middle">Evaluation and Results</h2>
        <h3 align="left">Performance Evaluation</h3>
        <p align="left"> We use three loss to evaluate the performance of the VQ-VAE-2 model: </p>
