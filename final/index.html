    <h1 align="middle">CS 184 Final Project</h1>
    <h1 align="middle">Fluid Super Resolution</h1>
    <h3 align="middle">Charles Cai, Congrong Xu, Franklin Zhang, Yunqi Li</h3>

    <h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
    <p align="left">In this project, we aimed at building a prediction model for fluid simulation.
        However, after some test & trials, we found that directly predicting the next frame of the fluid simulation
        would results in high prediction error and low visual quality as the time step increases.
        Therefore, we decided to modify our project to focus on speeding up the fluid simulation process by
        super-resolving the low-resolution fluid simulation data.
    </p>

    <div>
        <h2 align="middle">Progress</h2>
        <h3 align="left">Physical Method</h3>
        <p align="left"> In this project, we apply the spectral method, which is often employed in computational fluid
            dynamics (CFD).
            The spectral method is a numerical technique used to approximate solutions to differential equations
            by representing the solution as a sum of basis functions in the spectral domain after applying Fourier
            Transform.
            The spectral method is particularly useful for solving partial differential equations in multiple
            dimensions.
            In the context of fluid dynamics, spectral methods are often employed for solving the Navier-Stokes
            equations,
            which indicate the pattern of fluid flow.
        </p>

        <p align="left"> When it comes to fluid simulation using spectral methods, the Poisson equation and the
            Crank-Nicolson update
            are key components used in conjunction with the Navier-Stokes equations. In this case, we solved the Poisson
            equation in Fourier space
            to calculate the vorticity field from the velocity field. And use the Crank-Nicolson method to update the
            vorticity field,
            incorporating nonlinear advection, diffusion, and forcing effects, thus advancing the fluid simulation over
            successive time steps.
        </p>

        <h3 align="left">Fluid Simulations Dataset</h3>
        <p align="left"> We have generated a comprehensive dataset of 1,800 fluid simulations using the 2D
            Navier-Stokes equations, which simulates 2D incompressible viscous fluid. The
            simulations were performed on a 256x256 grid, subsampled to 64x64 for efficient storage. Each simulation
            captures the
            evolution of the vorticity field over a total time of 20.0 units, with a time step of 1e-4 and a viscosity
            of 1e-3.</p>

        <p align="left"> To create diverse initial conditions, we sampled the initial vorticity fields from a 2D
            Gaussian Random
            Field with
            covariance parameters alpha=2.5 and tau=7. The simulations were solved using a spectral method in Fourier
            space with a
            Crank-Nicolson time-stepping scheme, incorporating a forcing term defined as 0.1*(sin(2pi(x+y)) +
            cos(2pi(x+y))).</p>

        <p align="left">For each simulation, we recorded 200 snapshots(1 snapshots per 0.1s) of the vorticity field at
            equally spaced
            intervals, along with
            the
            vorticity fields at the previous and next time steps. The dataset was generated in batches of 40 simulations
            to manage computational resources
            efficiently.</p>
        <h3 align="left">VAE Pipeline For Super Resolution</h3>
        <p align="left"> We build up a VQ-VAE-2 training pipeline for the super resolution of fluid simulation data.
        </p>
        <!-- number list -->
        <ol>
            <li> Downsample the fluid simulation data by a factor of 8 on each axis to generate the low-resolution data.
            </li>
            <li> Upsample by a factor of 8 using bilinear interpolation. </li>
            <li> Concatenate 3 frames of the upsampled data to form the input to the VQ-VAE-2 model(Each frame differs
                by 0.5s). </li>
            <li> Feed the input date into the VQ-VAE-2 model to reconstruct the 3 frames of high-resolution data. </li>
            <li> Only pick the middle frame of the reconstructed data as the output and compute the reconstruction loss.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h3 align="left">Result Demonstration</h3>
        <p align="left"> We have trained the VQ-VAE-2 model on the fluid simulation dataset and generated some
            super-resolved fluid simulation data. The following images show the comparison among the ground truth
            high-resolution data, downsampled low-resolution data, bilinear upsampled data, and the VQ-VAE-2 upsampled
            data.
